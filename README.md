# Finding Genes from DNA

This project I made during my Course on Coursera.
It basically find all the Genes from DNA with
"ATG" StartCodon and "TAA" , "TAG" , "TGA" StopCodon 
at the end.

It also have some features like : 
* Counting No. of Genes in that DNA.
* Calculating the CG Ratio.
* Count No. of "CTG" strand in DNA.
* Calculating the Length of Longest Gene.
* Counting all the Genes which have length > 60 and having CG Ratio > 0.35.
* Displaying all the Genes.
